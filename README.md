# Gummy Worms Slack App

Wrote a simple and fun Rails web application hosted in Heroku where a user can click yes/no buttons in the frontend if there are gummy worms in the kitchen at Huge Inc (agency I work). I have jQuery click listeners that hijack the click event and send a response via JSON to an internal/informal Slack channel. I've used webhooks from the Slack API.
